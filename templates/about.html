            <h3>Abstract</h3>
            <p>
                Generative Artificial Intelligence (GenAI) is experiencing rapid growth across numerous industries, 
                with its adoption expected to expand even further. Despite its potential, educational institutions, 
                particularly those with limited funding, struggle to integrate GenAI into their workflows due to technical 
                challenges and resource constraints. This research addresses these barriers by developing an autonomous 
                GenAI-powered quiz generation system designed to streamline the creation of assessments. The system will 
                automatically integrate course materials into Learning Management Systems (LMS), enhancing accessibility 
                for educators while preserving the pedagogical quality of assessments. This project aims to bridge the 
                gap between technological innovation and educational application, empowering instructors with efficient 
                tools to improve learning outcomes.

            <h3>Background and Significance</h3>
            <p>
                Severe teacher shortages are a critical challenge facing education systems worldwide. For example, 
                33 countries currently lack enough teachers to ensure universal primary education by 2030. 
                To meet this goal, the world would need to recruit up to 25.8 million 
                schoolteachers (UNESCO Institute for Statistics, 2015). To address these issues, 
                the education sector should begin leveraging technology to enhance teaching efficiency 
                and reduce workload burdens, administrative tasks, and teacher burnout. Recent research 
                suggests that AI integration in education (AIED) could enable teachers to reallocate between 
                20% and 40% of their time (McKinsey & Company, 2020). Traditional quiz creation is often a time-consuming 
                and labor-intensive process that relies on manual input and fixed question formats, whereas an AI-driven 
                approach can dynamically generate assessments tailored to course content. This not only saves time but 
                also allows for more adaptive and personalized testing methods. According to a systemic analysis by 
                Zawacki-Richter, O., Marín, V. I., Bond, M., and Gouverneur, F. (2019), which examined over 20 years of 
                research on AIED, the authors assert that “Overall, the studies show that AI applications can perform 
                assessment and evaluation tasks with remarkable accuracy and efficiency” (p. 17). Despite this potential, 
                many existing AI tools remain inaccessible due to their complexity and the need for advanced programming 
                knowledge. Luckin, R., Holmes, W., Griffiths, M., and Forcier, L. B. (2016) describe AIED as, “something 
                of a cottage industry” continuing that, “development of a single monolithic AIEd system that tackles every 
                subject, and every possible learning scenario [is not feasible]. Instead, success will lie in the 
                development of a multitude of individual AIEd components that specialise in a particular expertise” (p. 51). 
                Further research supports this idea, with Roll, I., and Wylie, R. (2016) arguing that AIED should leverage 
                existing resources, such as Innovative Learning Environments (ILEs), which use technology to shape teaching 
                approaches. They contend that there is no need to reinvent the wheel, noting that ILE developers currently 
                create their own content, a process that is both labor-intensive and inefficient. They suggest, “Instead, 
                we suggest to build ILE that operates as a shell or an envelope for existing learning objects” (p. 594) 
                This project aligns with this perspective, proposing the development of an AI agent with an intuitive                     interface to simplify advanced data analysis. By utilizing existing resources and reducing technical 
                barriers, this AI-driven solution aims to democratize data analysis, enabling educators from diverse 
                disciplines to harness its capabilities for enhanced teaching and research outcomes.
